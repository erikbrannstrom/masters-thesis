\begin{itemize}
	\item Erik gave a brief description of the problem that the thesis will deal with. The research problems include the
		identification of an appropriate algorithm that the input data should be fed to as well as how to merge the output of that
		algorithm with a new campaign definition to suggest ad properties.
	\item Håkan explained the possibilities that exist for verifying the system using real-world testing. Matthias also suggested
		verification by inputting only a part of the data and then use the remaining data to verify the output.
	\item A simple prototype of the system should be demoed in about two weeks time.
	\item Extended proposal should be updated in the next week to reflect the discussions regarding thesis topic.
	\item Next meeting will be held July 9th at 11:00.
